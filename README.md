# Markov-Network-Based-Image-Segmentation

### This project is to segment the greyscale images based on spatial correlation and the similarity of the pixels within the same groups.

The details of the project is described in the paper: https://github.com/jay1204/Markov-Network-Based-Image-Segmentation/blob/master/Markov%20Network%20Based%20Image%20Segmentation.pdf

## How to run the code
The code is implementd in matlab. The instructions for running the code is describe in https://github.com/jay1204/Markov-Network-Based-Image-Segmentation/blob/master/read-me.txt
